1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
# After a couple days of practice with comparison operators I am very confident with my understanding and use 
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
# I am less confident with logical operators but, with the challenges today I feel like I made large steps in progress of getting to know them better.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
# If statements feel very familiar having built many excel documents with formulas and after getting a better grip on the operators they came to be easier with practice.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
# I went probably 20 minutes longer than I planned, however I did a challenge that was not the easiest and had to work through my internet dropping out for a few minutes so I feel like I am not far off track.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
# Adding more of the operators together to complete larger if statements, which will come with more time and challenges. Most likely will make time to join a study session one evening and ask some questions to other students. 
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
# Same from previous answer - may just join a study session one night to ask some more detailed questions on operators and statements and also use google to get more familiar .
